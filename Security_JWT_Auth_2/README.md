# Security_JWT_Auth_2 Project
This Spring Boot application security repository is based on a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9O9NI-RJ3o "YouTube video") that focuses on securing your REST API using both basic authentication and JWT token authentication. It provides a step-by-step guide to creating a secure REST API, implementing basic authentication, and setting up a custom security filter chain with JWT.

### Features
- JWT Token Authentication: Implement JWT token authentication to enhance security and user authentication for your REST API.
- User Details Service: Create a user details service class to manage user information, and integrate it with in-memory users for simplicity.
- Custom Security Filter Chain: Set up a custom security filter chain to extract and validate JWT tokens from incoming requests.
- Authorization Handling: Secure your API endpoints by checking for valid JWT tokens and authorizing requests based on token data.
